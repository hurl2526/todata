# ToDo List

ToDo List is an application that allows it's users to keep track and organize a list of things that need to get done in their lives!

# What it looks like  

# The app's features

Using the back end we've built, let's implement the following features on the FRONT END:

* Show priorities in addition to text.
* Show only not complete items.
* Show only high priority items.
* Move completed items to the bottom.
* Move high priority items to the top.

For those last two, we'll ALSO have to finish the sorting portion of our back end. Run `npm test` when you're ready to do a little back-end work!
